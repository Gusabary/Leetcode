### Files:

#### 921-parenthese.cpp

the code for problem 921.

Problems related to parentheses can be solved with `stack` always.

In this problem, I store the top element of the imaginary stack rather than use a real stack so that space complexity is relatively low while the effect is the same.

Also, there are some rules such as the **current** `(` must be redundant and there cannot exist `(` before any `)` in the redundant parentheses.
